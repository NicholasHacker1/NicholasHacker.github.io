I am a second year doctoral student at Texas A&M University in the Valeris-Chacin Lab. I hold a bachelors of sceince (B.S.) in Wildlife Biology from West Texas A&M University. I began my graduate school journey pursuing my masters of science with [Dr. Valeris-Chacin](https://www.veroresearch.org/people/valeris/), ultimately transitioning completly into a PhD position after a 1 1/2 years in the program. My research focuses on how we can use sequencing technology for enriched detection of etiological important bacteria in food systems. My research goal is to uncover the underlying cause of variation in bovine repiratory disease (BRD) cases within feedlot cattle.
